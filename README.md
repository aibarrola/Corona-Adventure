# Corona Adventure
A Choose Your Own Adventure Escape Room (COVID-20 edition)

__Context__:
Created a choose your own adventure website for my VSA family during the time of quarantine to keep them entertained at home!

__Challenges__:
One of the biggest barriers was when my Javascript file was not working. After hours of debugging, I realized it's because my AdBlocker blocked my Javascript file because it was named adv.js and the keyword 'adv' didn't allow it to run on my website.

__Results__:
The first deployed website I shared with my friends and family of around 100 people
