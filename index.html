            easy on me pls. Anyways, you'll be choosing your own adventure, kinda. There is only one path and if you make the wrong decision then you die and have to
            start over :) It's like that one episode of Black Mirror uh Bandersnatch? Yea! Enough of the intro and let's get right into it. You can do it with friends
            or by yourself but you must do it with your imagination :)
