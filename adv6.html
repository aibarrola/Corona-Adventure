            Calvin is the way to go, you lived. Congratulations! Thank you for playing through my adventure map. If you want me to make a longer version let me
             know because I was going to make it so you get kidnapped and you had to find the cure but I had no time. I hope everyone had fun during Revealing
            week and is super excited too meet their big. If you've already had been revealed, rememeber that you will recieve as much effort as you put into this
            program. I promise you'll have a great time with your big and line if you continue to put yourself out there to bond with them. Some littles
            might click with their big right away and others it might take some time. Don't compare your experience with others because each and every 
            experience is special and unique to you, and that's what makes this program so beautiful. <br>

            From your prez,
             Angelo <3 <br>
