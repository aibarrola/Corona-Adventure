        <h3 id="intro">Hello littles! I know a lot of y'all be hella bored so I made this choose-your-own-adventure game. I just learned to make websites so take it
            easy on me pls. Anyways, you'll be choosing your own adventure, kinda. There is only one path and if you make the wrong decision then you die and have to
            start over :) It's like that one episode of Black Mirror uh Bandersnatch? Yea! You also might have to use your 2 brain cells to figure out how to get through 
            the adventure. Sort of like an online escape room! Enough of the intro and let's get right into it! Enjoy!
